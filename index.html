        <h2>The Life of Martin Sennet Conner</h2>
        <p>
          Mike Conner was an accomplished politician, lawyer, and statesman. He
          attended the University of Mississippi at age 14 (likely the youngest
          in history), where he was the two-time president of his fraternity
          (the only in the chapter's history). After graduating, he continued
          his education at Yale University, where he obtained his
          <abbr title="Juris Doctor">J.D.</abbr> He returned to his home state
          and served as governor from <time>1932 — 1936</time>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conner's term as governor was short-lived, but historic. During the
          Great Depression, he was able move the state of Mississippi into a
          budget surplus. Other noted accomplishments were his relationship with
          Louisiana's governor of the time, (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_Pierce_Long,_Jr."
            >Huey Pierce Long, <abbr title="Junior">Jr</abbr>.</a
          >), and their building of interstate roads, and his grace toward
          prisoners.
        </p>
        <p>
          The former governor capped off his career as the first commissioner
          for the Southeastern Conference (that's right — the <abbr>SEC</abbr>,
          of Alabama and
          <abbr title="Louisiana State University">LSU</abbr> fame). He died on
          <time>September 16<sup>th</sup>, 1950</time> at the age of 59 and is
          buried in Jackson, Mississippi.
        </p>
        <p>
          The craziest thing is... I'm related to him! Yes, Martin Sennet Conner
          is my Great Grandfather. Thanks for reading my tribute to him! He was
          truly a motivated, driven man, and I strive to live up to his legacy.
